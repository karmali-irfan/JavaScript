After successfully developing an UNBEATABLE TIC-TAC-TOE AI using C++, my next goal was to make it more visual. Such that a used can simply 
click on an empty square on the screen to play their move. 

I used JavaScript to acheive this. 


---------- TO RUN THE GAME ------

I would reccommend you use VS Code to run the program. First, downlaod and save all the files for the game in one folder. 

Then click on file and the click on open folder. After you've done that you'll see an option to "GoLive" on the bottom right 
corner. Click on it to lauch the game on your browser, and now the game is ready to play. Just click on an empty square to 
play your move. 

If you want to replay the game, simply refresh the page.
